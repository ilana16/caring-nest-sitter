## Next Steps for Production
1. Set up backend API for calendar scraping (Flask app created but needs deployment)
2. Update frontend to use actual API endpoint instead of mock data
3. Test calendar scraping with real Google Calendar data
4. Deploy the updated application

The booking system is now fully functional with mock data and ready for testing. The calendar scraping functionality is implemented but currently uses test data for demonstration purposes.
