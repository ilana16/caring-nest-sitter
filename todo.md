# Project Update: Caring Nest Sitter

This document outlines the tasks to implement Firebase and Google Calendar integration for the Caring Nest Sitter website.

## Task List

- [ ] **Task 1: Clarify User Requirements** - Gather all necessary details from the user regarding Firebase setup and calendar integration.
- [ ] **Task 2: Clone Repository** - Clone the project repository from GitHub.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Firebase Initialization**
    - [x] Review project structure to determine the best file for Firebase initialization. (Determined `src/firebase.ts` and import in `src/main.tsx`)
    - [x] Create or modify the chosen file (e.g., `src/firebase.js`, `index.js`, or `App.js`) to include the Firebase configuration and initialization code provided by the user. (Created `src/firebase.ts`)
    - [x] Ensure Firebase is correctly imported and initialized in the main application entry point if a separate file is created. (Imported in `src/main.tsx`)
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement Google Calendar ICS Integration**
    - [x] Research and select a suitable library for fetching and parsing ICS data (e.g., `ical.js` or `node-ical`). (Selected `ical.js`)
    - [x] Install the chosen ICS parsing library as a project dependency. (Installed `ical.js` via npm)
    - [x] Create a new module or utility function to fetch the ICS data from the provided Google Calendar URL. (Created `fetchAndParseICS` in `src/utils/availability.ts`)
    - [x] Implement logic to parse the fetched ICS data and extract relevant availability information (event start/end times). (Implemented in `fetchAndParseICS` in `src/utils/availability.ts`)
    - [x] Determine how the booking form will consume this availability data and plan the integration (e.g., updating component state, using a global store). (Integrated into `BookingForm.tsx` state and effects)
    - [x] Modify the booking form component to utilize the fetched availability data, potentially disabling dates/times that are marked as busy. (Modified `BookingForm.tsx` to fetch ICS, parse events, and update `availableTimeSlots` accordingly, disabling unavailable slots)
- [ ] **Task 5: Commit and Push Changes** - Commit all the implemented changes to the local Git repository with a clear message and push them to the remote GitHub repository.
- [ ] **Task 6: Validate Site Build (if applicable)** - If the project has a build process, ensure it completes successfully after the changes. If it's a live site, check if the changes are reflected correctly.
- [ ] **Task 7: Report Completion to User** - Inform the user that the tasks are completed, providing a summary of changes and any relevant links or instructions.
