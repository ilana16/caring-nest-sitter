# Final Implementation Report

## ✅ COMPLETED: Google Calendar API Integration & Date Selector Fix

### Issues Resolved
1. **Date Selector Fixed**: The date selector was not allowing date selection due to empty `availableDays` array
2. **Google Calendar Integration**: Successfully connected to real Google Calendar ICS feed
3. **Real-time Availability**: System now fetches actual calendar events instead of using mock data
