# Visual Availability Indicators Implementation Report

## Overview
This report details the implementation of visual availability indicators for dates and times on the booking page, ensuring that "busy" slots are greyed out and strikethrough, while available slots are bold and selectable.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. `DateSelector.tsx` Enhancement
- Modified the `DateSelector` component to visually differentiate between available and unavailable dates.
- Integrated logic to grey out and strikethrough dates that are fully booked or fall outside business hours.
- Ensured that only selectable dates are clearly visible and interactive.

### 2. `TimeSlotSelector.tsx` Enhancement
- Updated the `TimeSlotSelector` component to apply visual styling based on time slot availability.
- Implemented styling to grey out and strikethrough busy time slots, making them unselectable.
- Applied bold styling to available time slots to enhance visibility and user experience.

### 3. `MultiStepBookingForm.tsx` Integration
- Ensured that the `MultiStepBookingForm` correctly passes the `busyEvents` data to the `DateSelector` component, allowing for accurate visual representation of availability.

### 4. Git Repository Updates
- All changes, including the `email-backend` directory (now tracked as a regular directory), have been committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Testing
The changes were tested by navigating through the booking process on the deployed application. The date and time selectors now visually reflect the availability as per the requirements, with busy slots being unselectable and available slots being clearly highlighted.

## Deployment
The updated frontend has been deployed to a new URL: `https://caxejukg.manus.space`.

## Conclusion
The booking page now provides a more intuitive user experience by clearly indicating available and unavailable dates and times, improving the overall usability of the booking system.
